# photo-randomizer

A script I wrote after discovering that my digital photo frame has a limit to how many photos it can display. This creates a copy of a photo library and randomly deletes a percentage of all photos in all subfolders - the resulting directory should be a near perfect fit for copying to the photo frame storage device.

Needs Python 3. To run, edit the file first and set the `variables maximum_no_of_files`, `original_dir` and `walk_dir`. Then simply run the file.
